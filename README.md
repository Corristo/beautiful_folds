# Beautiful Folds
Max Rabkin's beautiful folding for C++

Known to work with
  - GCC 9.2
  - Concepts branch of clang
    (https://github.com/saarraz/clang-concepts-monorepo/)
  - CMake 3.16

Visual Studio 2019 unfortunately has a regression
(https://github.com/brunocodutra/metal/issues/125) that affects all versions
with concepts support.
